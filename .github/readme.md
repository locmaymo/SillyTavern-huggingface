Mobile-friendly layout, Multi-API (KoboldAI/CPP, Horde, NovelAI, Ooba, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Claude, Scale), VN-like Waifu Mode, Stable Diffusion, TTS, WorldInfo (lorebooks), customizable UI, auto-translate, and more prompt options than you'd ever want or need + ability to install third-party extensions.

Based on a fork of [TavernAI](https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI) 1.2.8

## Important news!

1. We have created a [Documentation website](https://docs.sillytavern.app/) to answer most of your questions and help you get started.

2. Missing extensions after the update? Since the 1.10.6 release version, most of the previously built-in extensions have been converted to downloadable add-ons. You can download them via the built-in "Download Extensions and Assets" menu in the extensions panel (stacked blocks icon in the top bar).

3. Unsupported platform: android arm LEtime-web. 32-bit Android requires an external dependency that can't be installed with npm. Use the following command to install it: `pkg install esbuild`. Then run the usual installation steps.

### Brought to you by Cohee, RossAscends, and the SillyTavern community

### What is SillyTavern or TavernAI?

SillyTavern is a user interface you can install on your computer (and Android phones) that allows you to interact with text generation AIs and chat/roleplay with characters you or the community create.

SillyTavern is a fork of TavernAI 1.2.8 which is under more active development and has added many major features. At this point, they can be thought of as completely independent programs.

### Branches

SillyTavern is being developed using a two-branch system to ensure a smooth experience for all users.

* release -🌟 **Recommended for most users.** This is the most stable and recommended branch, updated only when major releases are pushed. It's suitable for the majority of users.
* staging - ⚠️ **Not recommended for casual use.** This branch has the latest features, but be cautious as it may break at any time. Only for power users and enthusiasts.

If you're not familiar with using the git CLI or don't understand what a branch is, don't worry! The release branch is always the preferable option for you.

### What do I need other than Tavern?

On its own Tavern is useless, as it's just a user interface. You have to have access to an AI system backend that can act as the roleplay character. There are various supported backends: OpenAPI API (GPT), KoboldAI (either running locally or on Google Colab), and more. You can read more about this in [the FAQ](https://docs.sillytavern.app/usage/faq/).

### Do I need a powerful PC to run Tavern?

Since Tavern is only a user interface, it has tiny hardware requirements, it will run on anything. It's the AI system backend that needs to be powerful.

## Mobile support

> **Note**

> **This fork can be run natively on Android phones using Termux. Please refer to this guide by ArroganceComplex#2659:**

> **Warning**

> DO NOT INSTALL INTO ANY WINDOWS CONTROLLED FOLDER (Program Files, System32, etc).

> DO NOT RUN START.BAT WITH ADMIN PERMISSIONS

### Windows

Installing via Git (recommended for easy updating)

An easy-to-follow guide with pretty pictures:
<https://docs.sillytavern.app/installation/windows/>

  1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) (latest LTS version is recommended)
  2. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32)
  3. Open Windows Explorer (`Win+E`)
  4. Browse to or Create a folder that is not controlled or monitored by Windows. (ex: C:\MySpecialFolder\)
  5. Open a Command Prompt inside that folder by clicking in the 'Address Bar' at the top, typing `cmd`, and pressing Enter.
  6. Once the black box (Command Prompt) pops up, type ONE of the following into it and press Enter:

* for Release Branch: `git clone https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern -b release`
* for Staging Branch: `git clone https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern -b staging`

  7. Once everything is cloned, double-click `Start.bat` to make NodeJS install its requirements.
  8. The server will then start, and SillyTavern will pop up in your browser.

Installing via ZIP download (discouraged)

  1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) (latest LTS version is recommended)
  2. Download the zip from this GitHub repo. (Get the `Source code (zip)` from [Releases](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/releases/latest))
  3. Unzip it into a folder of your choice
  4. Run `Start.bat` by double-clicking or in a command line.
  5. Once the server has prepared everything for you, it will open a tab in your browser.

### Linux

#### Unofficial Debian/Ubuntu PKGBUILD

> **This installation method is unofficial and not supported by the project. Report any issues to the PKGBUILD maintainer.**  
> The method is intended for Debian-based distributions (Ubuntu, Mint, etc).

1. Install [makedeb](https://www.makedeb.org/).
2. Ensure you have Node.js v18 or higher installed by running `node -v`. If you need to upgrade, you can install a [node.js repo](https://mpr.makedeb.org/packages/nodejs-repo) (you'll might need to edit the version inside the PKGBUILD). As an alternative, install and configure [nvm](https://mpr.makedeb.org/packages/nvm) to manage multiple node.js installations. Finally, you can [install node.js manually](https://nodejs.org/en/download), but you will need to update the PATH variable of your environment.
3. Now build the [sillytavern package](https://mpr.makedeb.org/packages/sillytavern). The build needs to run with the correct node.js version.

#### Manual

  1. Ensure you have Node.js v18 or higher (the latest [LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is recommended) installed by running `node -v`.
Alternatively, use the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) script to quickly and easily manage your Node installations.
  2. Run the `start.sh` script.
  3. Enjoy.

## API keys management

SillyTavern saves your API keys to a `secrets.json` file in the server directory.

By default, they will not be exposed to a frontend after you enter them and reload the page.

In order to enable viewing your keys by clicking a button in the API block:

1. Set the value of `allowKeysExposure` to `true` in `config.yaml` file.
2. Restart the SillyTavern server.

## Remote connections

Most often this is for people who want to use SillyTavern on their mobile phones while their PC runs the ST server on the same wifi network.

However, it can be used to allow remote connections from anywhere as well.

**IMPORTANT: SillyTavern is a single-user program, so anyone who logs in will be able to see all characters and chats, and be able to change any settings inside the UI.**

### 1. Managing whitelisted IPs

* Create a new text file inside your SillyTavern base install folder called `whitelist.txt`.
* Open the file in a text editor, and add a list of IPs you want to be allowed to connect.

*Both individual IPs and wildcard IP ranges are accepted. Examples:*

```txt
192.168.0.1
192.168.0.20
```

or

```txt
192.168.0.*
```

(the above wildcard IP range will allow any device on the local network to connect)

CIDR masks are also accepted (eg. 10.0.0.0/24).

* Save the `whitelist.txt` file.
* Restart your TAI server.

Now devices which have the IP specified in the file will be able to connect.

*Note: `config.yaml` also has a `whitelist` array, which you can use in the same way, but this array will be ignored if `whitelist.txt` exists.*

### 2. Getting the IP for the ST host machine

After the whitelist has been setup, you'll need the IP of the ST-hosting device.

If the ST-hosting device is on the same wifi network, you will use the ST-host's internal wifi IP:

* For Windows: windows button > type `cmd.exe` in the search bar > type `ipconfig` in the console, hit Enter > look for `IPv4` listing.

If you (or someone else) want to connect to your hosted ST while not being on the same network, you will need the public IP of your ST-hosting device.

* While using the ST-hosting device, access [this page](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) and look for `IPv4`. This is what you would use to connect from the remote device.

### 3. Connect the remote device to the ST host machine

Whatever IP you ended up with for your situation, you will put that IP address and port number into the remote device's web browser.

A typical address for an ST host on the same wifi network would look like this:

`http://192.168.0.5:8000`

Use http:// NOT https://

### Opening your ST to all IPs

We do not recommend doing this, but you can open `config.yaml` and change `whitelistMode` to `false`.

You must remove (or rename) `whitelist.txt` in the SillyTavern base install folder if it exists.

This is usually an insecure practice, so we require you to set a username and password when you do this.

The username and password are set in `config.yaml`.

After restarting your ST server, any device will be able to connect to it, regardless of their IP as long as they know the username and password.

### Still Unable To Connect?

* Create an inbound/outbound firewall rule for the port found in `config.yaml`. Do NOT mistake this for port-forwarding on your router, otherwise, someone could find your chat logs and that's a big no-no.
* Enable the Private Network profile type in Settings > Network and Internet > Ethernet. This is VERY important for Windows 11, otherwise, you would be unable to connect even with the aforementioned firewall rules.

## Performance issues?

Try enabling the No Blur Effect (Fast UI) mode on the User settings panel.
